# DharmaBit isn’t a company — we’re just a bunch of people who love building cool stuff with code.
This is our little corner of the internet where we learn, experiment, and create apps that (hopefully) make someone’s day a bit better.

For us, coding isn’t just about tech — it’s about sharing ideas, growing together, and having fun along the way.
Some projects are serious, others are just for fun — but all come from passion and curiosity.

## 💡 **About Us**
- A small community of curious minds and makers.  
- We love exploring, tinkering, and learning through open-source projects.  
- We believe technology is a great way to share kindness — even in small ways.  

## 🚀 **What We Do**
We build apps, run experiments, and try out random ideas — sometimes to learn, sometimes to help others.  
What matters most: enjoying the journey together 💙
